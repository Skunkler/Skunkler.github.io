    <p class="bio col-md-offset-4" id="firstP">Welcome! I am so pleased to introduce The Felted Forest to you all. I am a very small startup operation (just me and my sheep) located in rural southeastern IN. I have six shetland sheep here on our farm, and they work very hard at growing fleece and being absolutely adorable. Everything I make here is a one of a kind item, so if you see something you like, grab it! Even items that I replicate will all come out a little different, which I kind of love about needle felting and I hope you will too. I do some special ordering, as long as sufficient time in advance is given (details of which can be found in the special order tab). I hope you find something here you enjoy, or simply can't do without. I will be adding to the website as I develope both product, and vision for the future of The Felted Forest. Until then, enjoy the journey with me and the sheep!</p>
